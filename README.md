# DLX-Sudoku-Solver
 * This is a C++ implementation of Donald Knuth's Algorithm X using the Dancing Links technique(DLX Algorithm).
 
 * Benchmarked the solver for 9x9 sudoku against 4 difficulty std's by 4000+ boards to solve on average under 1 ms (max 7ms for any std of difficulty)

 * (in msec)
 *   	 Simple  	Easy  	Intermediate  	Expert
 * Max	 4.00	   4.00	     7.00	        4.00
 * Avg	 0.85	   1.19	     1.11	        0.87
